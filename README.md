The analysis also brings  out the relationship between production budget and gross revenue, that is worldwide and foreign revenue ,where the scatter plot indicates that worldwide gross is not correlated with the production budget while foreign gross has some level of positive correlation with the production budget.

****Conclusion**

From the analysis above, Microsoft should;

1.Focus on Avengers: Infinity War because it has a greater rating in terms of popularity, vote count and vote average.

2.Production budget has little to no impact on the gross returns of the movies.Microsoft should therefore should not pay so much attention on the production budget but rather on the final returns derived from availing any time of movie/film when putting into consideration the outside market.

3.Concentrate on Star Wars Ep. VII: The Force Awakens for the domestic market.This is because of its high rating iterms of domestic gross.
